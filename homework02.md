#### Question 1: <ins>Define the term essential difficulties as it is used by Brooks. Provide background and context with your answer and at least one example of an essential difficulty.
#### Ans:
- Essential difficulties, as defined by Brooks, are difficulties in software technology that are inherent in the nature of software.
- According to Brooks, these inherent difficulties in software development are something that cannot be overcome and must be accepted as part of the process, or we can say that there is no silver bullet that can significantly improve these essential difficulties.

- _An example of an essential difficulty is the difficulty of predicting and controlling the complexity of software systems_.
- Brooks argues that software systems become more complex as they are developed, and this increase in complexity makes it difficult to accurately predict the time and resources required to complete any project.

#### Question 2: <ins>Define the term accidental difficulties as it is used by Brooks. Provide background and context with your answer and at least one example of an accidental difficulty.
#### Ans:
- According to Brooks, accidental difficulties are those that today attend software's production, but they are not inherent.
- These difficulties are the consequences of the technology, design, and implementation choices made during the development process, and therefore, they are not core difficulties.
- Additionally, Brooks also argues that accidental difficulties are side effects of how humans have created and designed computer systems and, hence, can be eliminated as improvements are made.

- _For example, accidental difficulties can occur when software is dependent on rapidly changing technologies or tools, making it hard to keep up with the latest advancements_.
- Moreover, these difficulties also occur when there is poor communication between team members, leading to misunderstandings, conflicts, and rework.
- _Another example of accidental difficulty is when there is improper testing, which causes defects to be found too late in the development process_.

#### Question 3: <ins>List and briefly describe the four essential difficulties of developing software systems that Brooks identifies. Provide additional examples of each type of the four essential difficulties.


##### Ans: According to Brooks, the four essential difficulties of developing software are:
-	<ins>Complexity</ins>: Computer programs or software systems are complex in terms of interaction or communication among teams, components to be used, number of possible paths through the code, invoking new functions, and understanding all possible states of the program.
     Example: Consider a system that combines numerous APIs to offer consumers customized recommendations. This system must manage data from numerous sources, process and analyze the data, and provide the user with the results. The system's behavior is challenging to predict at this level of complexity.

-	<ins>Conformity</ins>: The fact that software exists in an arbitrary environment filled with varying interfaces, standards, security protocols, etc. To work, the software must conform to these external factors. Example: In the case of software development, there are no fundamental guidelines to follow. If we assign the task of writing a single program to five different developers, each one will use a different logic to implement it. Some may use recursion, some may use for loops, and some may use while loops. Despite using different approaches, they can all achieve the same goal. As a result, it is highly challenging to achieve uniformity in the case of software development as there are no defined fundamental principles that everyone must abide by, and different technologies and logic might be used to solve the same problem.

-	<ins>Changeability</ins>: Software is continuously subject to change. These requirements for software systems to change and evolve, due to any new requirements, performance improvements or to fix any new bugs increase the difficulty of software deployment.
     Example: Consider a shopping website that needs to be updated as new stocks come in or the new season of sale or clothes begins. These need to update constantly to meet customer preferences and requirements can impact large changes in the entire system and make it difficult to predict the outcome of the new changes.

-	<ins>Invisibility</ins>: The fact that software is invisible and unvisualizable. There exists no easy way to make people visualize the whole software within any graphs or diagrams. Despite progress in restricting and simplifying the structures of software, they remain inherently unvisualizable and thus do not permit the mind to use some of its most powerful conceptual tools which leads to difficulty in development.
     Example: Consider a supervised algorithm to predict stock prices. The system may appear to be working correctly during testing, but unexpected behavior may become apparent when it is used in the real world. The invisibility makes it difficult to predict and prevent such behavior.

To create a successful software system, these obstacles must be carefully evaluated and managed as they can provide substantial challenges for software development teams.
